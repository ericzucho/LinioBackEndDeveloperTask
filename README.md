Linio Back-End developer

Eric Zuchovicki

Programming language used: Python 3.4.3

-> Here is my solution to the task. It was a really challenging and entertaining one.

-> I'm sending two possible solutions that comply with the specified restrictions. The first one seems a little bit like
cheating to me, given that even though I don't use IF statements I use regular expressions and I didn't know if it was
allowed. The second one uses a single IF statement and makes better use of Python structures.

-> Running the program (python linio_numbers.py) runs both implementations, one after the other, followed by the unit
tests.

I hope you find it interesting!




Initial task description follows:
# Challenge - Backend Developer
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for
multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print
"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

# Requirements
* 1 if
* You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
* Unit tests
* You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at Linio we are
big fans of PHP, Kotlin and TypeScript

# Submission
You can create a public repository on your GitHub account and send the
link to us, or just send us a zip file.
